# Analyzing Crime in LA

## üåáüöî¬†Background


Los Angeles, California üòé. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World! Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs!

However, as with any highely populated city, it isn't always glamarous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where you can help!

You have been asked to support the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) by analyzing their crime data to identify patterns in criminal behavior. They plan to use your insights to allocate resources effectively to tackle various crimes in different areas.

You are free to use any methodologies that you like in order to produce your insights. 

# The Data

They have provided you with a single dataset to use. A summary and preview is provided below.

The data is publicly available [here](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8).

* You may also wish to visualize the distribution of crimes on a map.
